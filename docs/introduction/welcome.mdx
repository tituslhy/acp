## What is ACP?

The **Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)** is an open standard with open governance enabling  **seamless communication** between AI agents, regardless of their implementation details. In ACP, an **agent** is a software service that communicates through multimodal messages, primarily driven by natural language. The protocol is **agnostic** to how agents function internally, specifying only the **minimum assumptions** necessary for smooth interoperability. ACP defines a **standardized RESTful API** for managing and executing agents, supporting **synchronous**, **asynchronous**, and **streaming** interactions.

## Motivation

Enterprises today run hundreds to thousands of agents in silos, built on disparate technology stacks and unable to communicate. ACP unlocks agent-to-agent communication by standardizing interfaces, enabling agents from any technology stack to collaborate effectively and securely.

ACP is developed under open governance as a Linux Foundation project, alongside [BeeAI](https://docs.beeai.dev), an open platform to discover and run agents from any technology stack. This is because the ACP team believes that the standard should be community-driven and usable through an open implementation, available to all. No vendor lock-in, no adherence to a proprietary ecosystem.

## Design Philosophy

- **Simplicity First:** Easy to implement basic functionality.
- **Progressive Complexity**: Clear pathways to advanced capabilities without initial complexity.
- **Minimal Assumptions:** No assumed orchestration patterns or architectural requirements.

## Core Values

ACP is designed to deliver on core, differentiating values:

- **REST-based Communication**: ACP uses simple, clearly defined [REST endpoints](/spec/agents-list), aligning closely with standard HTTP patterns. Unlike protocols relying on more complex communication methods (such as JSON-RPC), ACP leverages widely-used HTTP conventions to simplify usage and integration into production environments.
- **No SDK Required (but we made one anyway)**: ACP is simple enough that you don’t need an SDK or specialized libraries. You can easily interact with ACP-compatible agents using standard HTTP tools like `curl`, Postman, or even your browser. Of course, since we’re developers too, we built an [SDK](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp/tree/main/python) anyway, just to make life even easier.
- **Offline Discovery**: Agents remain discoverable even when inactive, thanks to ACP’s manifest-based discovery. This enables agents to scale to zero while still being available for discovery and activation as needed.
- **Async-first, Sync Supported**: ACP is designed primarily for asynchronous communication, ideal for agents handling longer-running tasks. However, synchronous communication is also fully supported by default, simplifying development, rapid testing, and common use cases.
